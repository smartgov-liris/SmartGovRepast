Bugs that may occur :
a) When a new class is created, the display saved (mainly GIS 2D display) and the class is destroyed after that, a bug occurs.
To remove this bug, go to the display and manually erase the <styles> entry and the <layoutorder> entry of this class like : 
<entry>
      <string>environment.city.AgentBody</string>
      <null/>
</entry>
for the AgentBody class.
